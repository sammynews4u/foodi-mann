What can I expect from the business case?
</summary>
<p>Our business cases are in the final step of the recruitment process. They are practical ways for us to assess how creative and qualified you are! We don’t have templates, our hiring managers whip them up for each position.
The Business Case stage is a challenging step but follows two directions: for the candidate to see 
the practical side of the job, to know if it is what they are currently looking for, and for us to know how
 they approach different challenging tasks that will be part of their job.</p>
